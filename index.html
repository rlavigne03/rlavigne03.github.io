		<h2> About Me</h2>
			<p> My name is Rylee LaVigne and I am 19 years old. My birthday is next week on March 8th and I will be turning 20. I am currently a junior in my undergraduate degree at the University of South Carolina, and I am majoring is Biology. I transferred here in the fall of 2022 from a technical school in my hometown. From the technical school I graduated with an Associate of Science in the spring of 2022. My next goal is getting a Masters in Genetic Counseling. </p>
			<p id="pTwo" class="hidden"> Some random facts about me are that I am an only child, but grew up in a neighborhood with a lot of kids so it was okay. I have a tortie cat named Stella and a calico named Cailey. After moving to Columbia I made some pretty good friends in my three roommates and girls in similar majors. Some things I like to do are read, watch tv shows, do crafts, and hang out with my friends/boyfriend. I have always wanted to do be in a career that helped people and that worked with genetics/cancer. Lastly, my grandmother had cancer when I was younger, and since then I set my mind on the medical field and oncolgy. Genetic Counseling was a way to work with cancer but not be the actual doctor.</p>

		<h2> My Future Career Plans</h2>
			<p> With the educational path I`m on, I plan to continue going higher. An Associate of Science and a Bachelors in Biology, I plan on getting my Masters of Genetic Counseling. Genetic Counselors work in places such as hospitals, private practices and research facilities. They help you understand your genetic risks based on your family history, genetic risks for certain diseases or cancer, whether genetic testing might be right for you, and what the results mean.</p>
			<p id="pOne" class="hidden"> Genetic Counselors have training in medical genetics and counseling to guide and support patients seeking information about how inherited diseases might affect them, and to interpret genetic test results based on family history. They meet with individuals before or after genetic testing. They are specialized in areas like prenatal, pediatric, oncology, and psychiatry. As well as meeting with patients they can work in research, education, and industry. Also Genetic Counseling is a growing field with more and more opportunities coming with it.  </p>
